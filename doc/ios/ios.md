### [License](#license)

## <a id="example-apps"></a>Example apps

There is an iOS example app inside the [`iOS` directory][demo-app-ios]. You can open the Xamarin Studio project to see an example on how the adjust SDK can be integrated.

## <a id="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

We will describe the steps to integrate the adjust SDK into your Xamarin Studio iOS project. We are going to assume that you use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio for your iOS development.

### <a id="sdk-get"></a>Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Extract the archive into a directory of your choice.

If you want to use adjust bindings DLL you can start with [this step](#sdk-add-dll).

### <a id="sdk-add"></a>Add the SDK to your project

Choose to add an existing project to your solution.

![][add_ios_binding]

Select the `AdjustSdk.Xamarin.iOS` project file and hit `Open`.

![][select_ios_binding]

After this, you will have the adjust iOS bindings added as a submodule to your solution.

![][submodule_ios_binding]

### <a id="sdk-add-project"></a>Add the SDK project reference to your app

After you have successfully added the adjust iOS bindings project to your solution, you should also add a reference to it in your iOS app project properties.

![][reference_ios_binding]

In case you don't want to add reference to the adjust SDK via project reference, you can skip this step and add it as DLL reference to your app which is explained in the step below.

### <a id="sdk-add-dll"></a>Add the SDK DLL reference to your app

The next step is to add a reference to the bindings DLL in your iOS project properties. In the references window, choose the `.Net Assembly` pane and select the `AdjustSdk.Xamarin.iOS.dll` that you have downloaded.

![][select_ios_dll]

### <a id="sdk-integrate"></a>Integrate the SDK into your app

To start with, we'll set up basic session tracking.

Open the source file of your app delegate. Add the `using` statement at the top of the file, then add the following call to `Adjust` in the `FinishedLaunching` method of your app delegate:

```cs
using AdjustBindingsiOS;

// ...

string yourAppToken = "{YourAppToken}";
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;

var config = ADJConfig.ConfigWithAppToken(yourAppToken, environment);

Adjust.AppDidLaunch(adjustConfig);
```

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your [dashboard].

Depending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must set `environment` with one of these values:

```cs
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction;
```

**Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` if and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction` just before you publish the app. Set it back to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` when you start developing and testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.

### <a id="adjust-logging"></a>Adjust logging

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see in tests by setting `LogLevel` property on your `ADJConfig` instance with one of the following parameters:

```cs
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Verbose;  // enable all logging
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Debug;    // enable more logging
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Info;     // the default
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Warn;     // disable info logging
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Error;    // disable warnings as well
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Assert;   // disable errors as well
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Suppress; // disable all logging
```

If you don't want your app in production to display any logs coming from the adjust SDK, then you should select `ADJLogLevel.Suppress` and in addition to that, initialise `ADJConfig` object with another constructor where you should enable suppress log level mode:

```cs
using AdjustBindingsiOS;

// ...

string yourAppToken = "{YourAppToken}";
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;

var config = ADJConfig.ConfigWithAppToken(yourAppToken, environment);
config.LogLevel = ADJLogLevel.Suppress;

Adjust.AppDidLaunch(adjustConfig);
```

### <a id="additional-settings"></a>Additional settings

In order to get Xamarin iOS app project to recognize categories from adjust iOS bindings, you need to add additional mtouch arguments to your `iOS Build`. You can find this in the `Build` section of your `Project Options`. Add the `-gcc_flags` option followed by a quoted string, containing the `-ObjC` argument.

![][additional_flags]

### <a id="build-your-app"></a>Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you should carefully read the SDK logs in the console. After the app launched for the first time, you should see the info log `Install tracked`.

![][run]

## <a id="additional-features"></a>Additional features

Once you integrate the adjust SDK into your app, you can take advantage of the following features.

### <a id="event-tracking"></a>Event tracking

You can use adjust to track events. Let's say you want to track every tap on a particular button. You would create a new event token in your [dashboard], which has an associated event token - resembling something like `abc123`. In your button's `TouchUpInside` handler you would then add the following lines to track the tap:

```cs
var adjustEvent = ADJEvent.EventWithEventToken("abc123");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

When tapping the button you should now see `Event tracked` in the logs.

### <a id="revenue-tracking"></a>Revenue tracking

If your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making In-App Purchases you can track those revenues with events. Let's say a tap is worth one Euro cent. You could then track the revenue event like this:

```cs
var adjustEvent = ADJEvent.EventWithEventToken("abc123");

adjustEvent.SetRevenue(0.01, "EUR");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

When you set a currency token, adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your choice. Read more about [currency conversion here.][currency-conversion]

You can read more about revenue and event tracking in the [event tracking guide][event-tracking].

### <a id="revenue-deduplication"></a>Revenue deduplication

You can also add an optional transaction ID to avoid tracking duplicate revenues. The last ten transaction IDs are remembered, and revenue events with duplicate transaction IDs are skipped. This is especially useful for In-App Purchase tracking. You can see an example below.

If you want to track in-app purchases, please make sure to call `TrackEvent` after `FinishTransaction` in `UpdatedTransaction` only if the state changed to `SKPaymentTransactionState.Purchased`. That way you can avoid tracking revenue that is not actually being generated.

```cs
public void UpdatedTransactions(SKPaymentQueue queue, SKPaymentTransaction[] transactions)
{
    foreach (SKPaymentTransaction transaction in transactions) 
    {
        switch (transaction.TransactionState)
        {
            case SKPaymentTransactionState.Purchased:
                SKPaymentQueue.DefaultQueue.FinishTransaction(transaction);

                var adjustEvent = ADJEvent.EventWithEventToken("abc123");

                adjustEvent.SetRevenue(0.01, "{currency}");
                adjustEvent.SetTransactionId(transaction.TransactionIdentifier);

                Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);

                break;

                // More cases
        }
    }
}
```

### <a id="iap-verification"></a>In-App Purchase verification

In-App purchase verification can be done with Xamarin purchase SDK which is currently being developed and will soon be publicly available. For more information, please contact support@adjust.com.

### <a id="callback-parameters"></a>Callback parameters

You can register a callback URL for your events in your [dashboard]. We will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event is tracked. You can add callback parameters to that event by calling `AddCallbackParameter` on the event before tracking it. We will then append these parameters to your callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL `http://www.adjust.com/callback` then track an event like this:

```csharp
var adjustEvent = ADJEvent.EventWithEventToken("abc123");

adjustEvent.AddCallbackParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.AddCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

```
http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar
```

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}` that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback this placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current device. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event, these parameters won't even be read.

You can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our [callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].

### <a id="partner-parameters"></a>Partner parameters

You can also add parameters to be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your adjust dashboard.

This works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the `AddPartnerParameter` method on your `ADJEvent` instance.

```cs
var adjustEvent = ADJEvent.EventWithEventToken("abc123");

adjustEvent.AddPartnerParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.AddPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

You can read more about special partners and these integrations in our [guide to special partners.][special-partners]

### <a id="session-parameters"></a>Session parameters

Some parameters are saved to be sent in every event and session of the adjust SDK. Once you have added any of these parameters, you don't need to add them every time, since they will be saved locally. If you add the same parameter twice, there will be no effect.

These session parameters can be called before the adjust SDK is launched to make sure they are sent even on install. If you need to send them with an install, but can only obtain the needed values after launch, it's possible to [delay](#delay-start) the first launch of the adjust SDK to allow this behaviour.

### <a id="session-callback-parameters"></a>Session callback parameters

The same callback parameters that are registered for [events](#callback-parameters) can be also saved to be sent in every event or session of the adjust SDK.

The session callback parameters have a similar interface of the event callback parameters. Instead of adding the key and it's value to an event, it's added through a call to `Adjust` method `AddSessionCallbackParameter`:

```cs
Adjust.AddSessionCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");
```

The session callback parameters will be merged with the callback parameters added to an event. The callback parameters added to an event have precedence over the session callback parameters. Meaning that, when adding a callback parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the callback parameter added to the event.

It's possible to remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `RemoveSessionCallbackParameter`.

```cs
Adjust.RemoveSessionCallbackParameter("foo");
```

If you wish to remove all key and values from the session callback parameters, you can reset it with the method `ResetSessionCallbackParameters`.

```cs
Adjust.ResetSessionCallbackParameters();
```

### <a id="session-partner-parameters"></a>Session partner parameters

In the same way that there is [session callback parameters](#session-callback-parameters) that are sent every in event or session of the adjust SDK, there is also session partner parameters.

These will be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your adjust [dashboard].

The session partner parameters have a similar interface to the event partner parameters. Instead of adding the key and it's value to an event, it's added through a call to `Adjust` method `AddSessionPartnerParameter`:

```cs
Adjust.AddSessionPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");
```

The session partner parameters will be merged with the partner parameters added to an event. The partner parameters added to an event have precedence over the session partner parameters. Meaning that, when adding a partner parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the partner parameter added to the event.

It's possible to remove a specific session partner parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `RemoveSessionPartnerParameter`.

```cs
Adjust.RemoveSessionPartnerParameter("foo");
```

If you wish to remove all key and values from the session partner parameters, you can reset it with the method `ResetSessionPartnerParameters`.

```cs
Adjust.ResetSessionPartnerParameters();
```

### <a id="delay-start"></a>Delay start

Delaying the start of the adjust SDK allows your app some time to obtain session parameters, such as unique identifiers, to be send on install.

Set the initial delay time in seconds with the `DelayStart` property of the `ADJConfig` instance:

```objc
config.DelayStart = 5.5;
```

In this case this will make the adjust SDK not send the initial install session and any event created for 5.5 seconds. After this time is expired or if you call `Adjust.SendFirstPackages()` in the meanwhile, every session parameter will be added to the delayed install session and events and the adjust SDK will resume as usual.

**The maximum delay start time of the adjust SDK is 10 seconds**.

### <a id="attribution-callback"></a>Attribution callback

You can register a callback to be notified of tracker attribution changes. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this information can not by provided synchronously. Follow these steps to implement the optional callback in your app:

Please make sure to consider our [applicable attribution data policies.][attribution-data]

1. Open `AppDelegate.cs` and create a class which inherits from `AdjustDelegate` and override its `AdjustAttributionChanged` method.
    
    ```cs
    public class AdjustDelegateXamarin : AdjustDelegate
    {
        public override void AdjustAttributionChanged (ADJAttribution attribution)
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("Attribution changed!");
            Console.WriteLine ("New attribution: {0}", attribution.ToString ());
        }
    }
    ```

2. Add the private field of type `AdjustDelegateXamarin` to this `AppDelegate` class.

    ```cs
    private AdjustDelegateXamarin adjustDelegate = null;
    ```

3. Initialize and set the delegate with your `ADJConfig` instance:

    ```cs
    adjustDelegate = new AdjustDelegateXamarin();
    
    // ...
    
    adjustConfig.Delegate = adjustDelegate;
    ```
    
As the delegate callback is configured using the `ADJConfig` instance, you should set the `Delegate` property before calling `Adjust.AppDidLaunch(adjustConfig)`.

The callback function will be called  when the SDK receives final attribution data. Within the callback function you have access to the `attribution` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its properties:

- `string TrackerToken` the tracker token of the current attribution.
- `string TrackerName` the tracker name of the current attribution.
- `string Network` the network grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string Campaign` the campaign grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string Adgroup` the ad group grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string Creative` the creative grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string ClickLabel` the click label of the current attribution.
- `string Adid` the adjust device identifier.

### <a id="session-event-callbacks"></a>Session and event callbacks

You can register a callback to be notified of successful and failed events and/or sessions. Like with attribution callback, this should be done in your custom class which inherits from `AdjustDelegate`.

Follow the same steps to implement the following callback function for successful tracked events:

```cs
public class AdjustDelegateXamarin : AdjustDelegate
{
    public override void AdjustEventTrackingSucceeded(ADJEventSuccess eventSuccessResponseData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event tracking succeeded! Info: " + eventSuccessResponseData.ToString());
    }
}
```

The following callback function for failed tracked events:

```cs
public class AdjustDelegateXamarin : AdjustDelegate
{
    public override void AdjustEventTrackingFailed(ADJEventFailure eventFailureResponseData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event tracking failed! Info: " + eventFailureResponseData.ToString());
    }
}
```

For successful tracked sessions:

```cs
public class AdjustDelegateXamarin : AdjustDelegate
{
    public override void AdjustSessionTrackingSucceeded(ADJSessionSuccess sessionSuccessResponseData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Session tracking succeeded! Info: " + sessionSuccessResponseData.ToString());
    }
}
```

And for failed tracked sessions:

```cs
public class AdjustDelegateXamarin : AdjustDelegate
{
    public override void AdjustSessionTrackingFailed(ADJSessionFailure sessionFailureResponseData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Session tracking failed! Info: " + sessionFailureResponseData.ToString());
    }
}
```

The callback functions will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the callback you have access to a response data object specifically for the callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:

- `string Message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.
- `string Timestamp` timestamp from the server.
- `string Adid` a unique device identifier provided by adjust.
- `NSDictionary<string, object> JsonResponse` the JSON object with the response from the server.

Both event response data objects contain:

- `string EventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event.

And both event and session failed objects also contain:

- `bool WillRetry` indicates there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.

### <a id="disable-tracking"></a>Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking by invoking the method `SetEnabled` with the enabled parameter as `false`. **This setting is remembered between sessions**, but it can only be activated after the first session.

```cs
Adjust.SetEnabled(false);
```

You can verify if the adjust SDK is currently active with the property `IsEnabled`. It is always possible to activate the adjust SDK by invoking `SetEnabled` with the enabled parameter set to `true`.

### <a id="offline-mode"></a>Offline mode

You can put the adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers, while retaining tracked data to be sent later. When in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events.

You can activate offline mode by calling `SetOfflineMode` with the parameter `true`.

```cs
Adjust.SetOfflineMode(true);
```

Conversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling `SetOfflineMode` with `false`. When the adjust SDK is put back in online mode, all saved information is send to our servers with the correct time information.

Unlike disabling tracking, **this setting is not remembered** between sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.

### <a id="event-buffering"></a>Event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable event buffering with your `ADJConfig` instance:

```cs
var config = ADJConfig.ConfigWithAppToken(yourAppToken, environment);

config.EventBufferingEnabled = true;

Adjust.AppDidLaunch(config);
```

If nothing is set, event buffering is **disabled by default**.

### <a id="sdk-signature"></a>SDK signature

An account manager must activate the Adjust SDK signature. Contact Adjust support (support@adjust.com) if you are interested in using this feature.

If the SDK signature has already been enabled on your account and you have access to App Secrets in your Adjust Dashboard, please use the method below to integrate the SDK signature into your app.

An App Secret is set by passing all secret parameters (`secretId`, `info1`, `info2`, `info3`, `info4`) to `setAppSecret` method of `AdjustConfig` instance:

```csharp
AdjustConfig adjustConfig = AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

adjustConfig.SetAppSecret(secretId, info1, info2, info3, info4);

Adjust.OnCreate(adjustConfig);
```

### <a id="background-tracking"></a>Background tracking

The default behaviour of the adjust SDK is to **pause sending HTTP requests while the app is in the background**. You can change this in your `ADJConfig` instance:

```cs
var config = ADJConfig.ConfigWithAppToken(yourAppToken, environment);

config.SendInBackground = true;

Adjust.AppDidLaunch(config);
```

If nothing set, sending in background is **disabled by default**.

### <a id="device-ids"></a>Device IDs

The adjust SDK offers the possibility to obtain some device identifiers.

### <a id="di-idfa"></a>iOS Advertising Identifier

Certain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate device and client IDs in order to prevent duplicate reporting.

To obtain the IDFA device identifier, access the `Idfa` property of the `Adjust` instance:

```cs
string idfa = Adjust.Idfa;
```

### <a id="di-adid"></a>Adjust device identifier

For each device with your app installed, the adjust backend generates a unique **adjust device identifier** (**adid**). In order to obtain this identifier, you can access the following property of the `Adjust` instance:

```cs
stirng adid = Adjust.Adid;
```

**Note**: Information about the **adid** is available after the app's installation has been tracked by the adjust backend. From that moment on, the adjust SDK has information about the device **adid** and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access the **adid** before the SDK has been initialised and the installation of your app has been successfully tracked.

### <a id="user-attribution"></a>User attribution

The attribution callback will be triggered as described in the [attribution callback section](#attribution-callback), providing you with information about any new attribution whenever it changes. If you want to access information about a user's current attribution at any other time, you can do so through the following property of the `Adjust` instance:

```cs
ADJAttribution attribution = Adjust.Attribution;
```

### <a id="push-token"></a>Push token

To send us the push notifications token, then add the following call to Adjust **when ever you get your token in the app or when it gets updated**:

```cs
NSData pushNotificationsToken;	// Obtain and assign your push notification token as NSData type.

Adjust.SetDeviceToken(pushNotificationsToken);
```

Push tokens are used for the Adjust Audience Builder and client callbacks, and are required for the upcoming uninstall tracking feature.

### <a id="pre-installed-trackers"></a>Pre-installed trackers

If you want to use the adjust SDK to recognize users that found your app pre-installed on their device, follow these steps.

1. Create a new tracker in your [dashboard].
2. Open your app delegate and add set the default tracker of your `ADJConfig`:

    ```cs
    var config = ADJConfig.ConfigWithAppToken(yourAppToken, environment);

    config.DefaultTracker = "{TrackerToken}";

    Adjust.AppDidLaunch(config);
    ```

  Replace `{TrackerToken}` with the tracker token you created in step 2. Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker 
  URL (including `http://app.adjust.com/`). In your source code, you should specify only the six-character token and not the
  entire URL.

3. Build and run your app. You should see a line like the following in app's log output:

    ```
    Default tracker: 'abc123'
    ```

### <a id="deeplinking"></a>Deep linking

If you are using the adjust tracker URL with an option to deep link into your app from the URL, there is the possibility to get info about the deep link URL and its content. Hitting the URL can happen when the user has your app already installed (standard deep linking scenario) or if they don't have the app on their device (deferred deep linking scenario).

For more detailed information about deep linking in iOS and how to enable it for your app, please check our [official iOS SDK README][ios-readme-deeplinking].

### <a id="deeplinking-standard"></a>Standard deep linking scenario

If your user already has the app installed and hits the tracker URL with deep link information in it, your application will get opened and the content of the deep link will be sent to your app so that you can parse it and decide what to do next in your app. As you have read in our official iOS SDK README, deep linking in iOS at this moment can be done with usage of custom URL scheme in tracker URL (iOS 8 and earlier) or with usage of universal links (iOS 9 and newer).

Depending on which scenario you want to use for your app (or if you want to use them both to support wide range of devices), you need to set up your app to handle one of these or both scenarios.

### <a id="deeplinking-setup-old"></a>Deep linking on iOS 8 and earlier

In order to set deep linking support for iOS 8 and earlier devices, you need to set up custom URL scheme in your app's `Info.plist` file. Open your `Info.plist` file and go to `Advanced` tab. In there, fill in your `Bundle ID` value in `Identifier` field and custom URL scheme for your app in `URL Schemes` field.

![][deeplinking_custom_url_scheme]

With this completed, when you app gets opened by click on tracker URL with deep link info which contains your custom URL scheme in it, `OpenUrl` method in your `AppDelegate` class will get called and you will get the deep link info in there.

```cs
public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication application, NSUrl url, string sourceApplication, NSObject annotation)
{
    // url -> This is your deep link content.

    return true;
}
```

With this setup, you have successfully set up deep linking handling for iOS devices with iOS 8 and earlier versions.

### <a id="deeplinking-setup-new"></a>Deep linking on iOS 9 and later

In order to set deep linking support for iOS 9 and later devices, you need to enable your app to handle Apple universal links. If you followed our official iOS SDK README instructions, you have successfully enabled `Associated Domains` for your app in Apple Developer portal. In order to enable this in your app project, please open `Entitlements.plist`. In there you will see `Associated Domains` part which you need to enable by checking the `Enable Associated Domains` check box. After this you only need to add domain which was generated for you in the adjust dashboard.

![][deeplinking_universal_links]

With this completed, when your app gets opened by click on universal link, `ContinueUserActivity` method in your `AppDelegate` class will get called and you will get the deep link info in there.

```cs
public override bool ContinueUserActivity(UIApplication application, NSUserActivity userActivity, UIApplicationRestorationHandler completionHandler)
{
    if (userActivity.ActivityType == NSUserActivityType.BrowsingWeb)
    {
        // userActivity.WebPageUrl -> This is your deep link content.
    }

    return true;
}
```

With this setup, you have successfully set up deep linking handling for iOS devices with iOS 9 and later versions.

### <a id="deeplinking-deferred"></a>Deferred deep linking scenario

In order to get info about the URL content in a deferred deep linking scenario, you should implement a callback method in the same way like you were setting callbacks for attribution, events and sessions. You need to override `AdjustDeeplinkResponse` in the class which inherits from `AdjustDelegate`:

```cs
public class AdjustDelegateXamarin : AdjustDelegate
{
    public override bool AdjustDeeplinkResponse(NSUrl deeplink)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("adjust: Deferred deep link received! URL = " + deeplink.ToString());

        return true;
        // return false;
    }
}
```

In deferred deep linking scenario, there is one additional setting which can be set in the `AdjustDeeplinkResponse` method via it's return value. Once the adjust SDK gets the deferred deep link info, we are offering you the possibility to choose whether our SDK should open this URL or not. You can choose to set this option by returning either `true` if you want us to open the URL or `false` if you don't want us to do anything.

If this callback is not implemented, **the adjust SDK will always try to launch the URL by default**.

### <a id="deeplinking-reattribution"></a>Reattribution via deep links

Adjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns with usage of deep links. For more information on how to do that, please check our [official docs][reattribution-with-deeplinks]. 

If you are using this feature, in order for your user to be properly reattributed, you need to make one additional call to the adjust SDK in your app.

Once you have received deep link content information in your app, add a call to `Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl` method. By making this call, the adjust SDK will try to find if there is any new attribution info inside of the deep link and if any, it will be sent to the adjust backend. If your user should be reattributed due to a click on the adjust tracker URL with deep link content in it, you will see the [attribution callback](#attribution-callback) in your app being triggered with new attribution info for this user.

The call to `Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl` should be done like this to support deeplinking in all iOS versions:

```cs
public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication application, NSUrl url, string sourceApplication, NSObject annotation)
{
    // url -> This is your deep link content.
    Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl(url);

    return true;
}
```

```cs
public override bool ContinueUserActivity(UIApplication application, NSUserActivity userActivity, UIApplicationRestorationHandler completionHandler)
{
    if (userActivity.ActivityType == NSUserActivityType.BrowsingWeb)
    {
        // userActivity.WebPageUrl -> This is your deep link content.
        Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl(userActivity.WebPageUrl);
    }

    return true;
}
```
