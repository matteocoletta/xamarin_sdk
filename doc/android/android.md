## <a id="example-apps"></a>Example apps

There is an Android example app inside the [`Android` directory][demo-app-android]. You can open the Xamarin Studio project to see an example of how to integrate the adjust SDK.

## <a id="basic-integration"></a>Basic integration

We will describe the steps to integrate the adjust SDK into your Xamarin project. We are going to assume that you use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio for your Android development.

### <a id="sdk-get"></a>Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Extract the archive into a directory of your choice.

If you want to use adjust bindings DLL you can start with [this step](#sdk-add-dll).

### <a id="sdk-add"></a>Add the SDK to your project

Choose to add an existing project to your solution.

![][add_android_binding]

Select the `AdjustSdk.Xamarin.Android` project file and hit `Open`.

![][select_android_binding]

You will now have adjust Android bindings added as submodule to your solution.

![][submodule_android_binding]

### <a id="sdk-add-project"></a>Add the SDK project reference to your app

After you have successfully added the adjust Android bindings project to your solution, you should also add a reference to it in your Android app project properties.

![][reference_android_binding]

In case you don't want to add reference to the adjust SDK via project reference, you can skip this step and add it as DLL reference to your app which is explained in the step below.

### <a id="sdk-add-dll"></a>Add the SDK DLL reference to your app

The next step is to add a reference to the bindings DLL in your Android project properties. In the references window, choose the `.Net Assembly` pane and select the `AdjustSdk.Xamarin.Android.dll` that you have downloaded.

![][select_android_dll]

### <a id="sdk-gps"></a>Add Google Play Services

Since the 1st of August of 2014, apps in the Google Play Store must use the Google Advertising ID to uniquely identify devices. To allow the adjust SDK to use the Google Advertising ID, you must integrate Google Play Services. If you haven't done this yet, follow these steps:

1. Choose to `Add Packages` by your `Packages` folder in Android app project.

	![][add_packages]

2. Search for `Xamarin Google Play Services - Analytics` and add them to your app.

	![][add_gps_to_app]

3. After you have added Google Play Services Analytics to your Android app project, the content of your `Packages` folder should look like this:

	![][gps_added]

### <a id="sdk-add-gps"></a>Add permissions

In `Properties` folder, open the `AndroidManifest.xml` of your Android app project. Add the `Internet` and `AccessNetworkState` permission if it's not already there.

![][permission_internet]

If you are **not targeting the Google Play Store**, add the `AccessWifiState` permission as well:

![][permission_wifi_network_state]

### <a id="android-referrer"></a>Install referrer

In order to correctly attribute an install of your Android app to its source, Adjust needs information about the **install referrer**. This can be obtained by using the **Google Play Referrer API** or by catching the **Google Play Store intent** with a broadcast receiver.

**Important**: The Google Play Referrer API is newly introduced by Google with the express purpose of providing a more reliable and secure way of obtaining install referrer information and to aid attribution providers in the fight against click injection. It is **strongly advised** that you support this in your application. The Google Play Store intent is a less secure way of obtaining install referrer information. It will continue to exist in parallel with the new Google Play Referrer API temporarily, but it is set to be deprecated in future.

#### <a id="android-referrer-gpr-api"></a>Google Play Referrer API

Google Play Referrer API is already included in Adjust SDK. Nothing more needs to be done.

Also, make sure that you have paid attention to the [Proguard settings](#android-proguard) chapter and that you have added all the rules mentioned in it, especially the one needed for this feature:

```
-keep public class com.android.installreferrer.** { *; }
```

This feature is supported if you are using the **Adjust SDK v4.12.0 or above**.

#### <a id="android-referrer-gps-intent"></a>Google Play Store intent

The Google Play Store `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent should be captured with a broadcast receiver. The Adjust install referrer broadcast receiver is added to your app by default. For more information, you can check our native [Android SDK README][broadcast-receiver]. We've included a class called `AdjustReferrerReceiver.cs` in our plugin which automatically captures that intent. The full name of the class is `com.adjust.binding.AdjustReferrerReceiver.cs`. Feel free to use it for testing install referrers by triggering it manually. More on that [here][testing-broadcast-receivers].

Please bear in mind that if you are using your own broadcast receiver which handles the `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent, you don't need to use Adjust broadcast receiver. Simply add the call to the Adjust broadcast receiver as described in our [Android guide][broadcast-receiver-custom] in your custom receiver.

### <a id="sdk-proguard"></a>Proguard settings

If you are using Proguard, add these lines to your Proguard file:

```
-keep public class com.adjust.sdk.** { *; }
-keep class com.google.android.gms.common.ConnectionResult {
    int SUCCESS;
}
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient {
    com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info getAdvertisingIdInfo(android.content.Context);
}
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info {
    java.lang.String getId();
    boolean isLimitAdTrackingEnabled();
}
-keep class dalvik.system.VMRuntime {
    java.lang.String getRuntime();
}
-keep class android.os.Build {
    java.lang.String[] SUPPORTED_ABIS;
    java.lang.String CPU_ABI;
}
-keep class android.content.res.Configuration {
    android.os.LocaleList getLocales();
    java.util.Locale locale;
}
-keep class android.os.LocaledList {
    java.util.Locale get(int);
}
-keep public class com.android.installreferrer.** { *; }
```

If you are **not targeting the Google Play Store**, you can remove the `com.google.android.gms` rules.

### <a id="sdk-integrate"></a>Integrate the SDK into your app

To start with, we'll set up basic session tracking.

We recommend using a global Android [Application][android_application] class to initialize the SDK. If don't have one in your app already, create a class that extends `Application`.

![][application_class]

In your `Application` class, find or create the `onCreate` method and add the following code to initialize the adjust SDK:

```cs
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;

var config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

Adjust.OnCreate(config);
```

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your [dashboard].

Depending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must set the `environment` with one of these values:

```cs
const String environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
const String environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction;
```

**Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` if and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction` just before you publish the app. Set it back to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` when you start developing and testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.

### <a id="session-tracking"></a>Session tracking

**Note**: This step is **really important** and please **make sure that you implement it properly in your app**. By implementing it, you will enable proper session tracking by the adjust SDK in your app.

### <a id="session-tracking-api14"></a>API level 14 and higher

1. Add a private class that implements the `Java.Lang.Object` and  `IActivityLifecycleCallbacks` interface. If you don't have access to this interface, your app is targeting an Android API level inferior to 14. You will have to update manually each Activity by following these [instructions](#session-tracking-api9). If you had `Adjust.OnResume` and `Adjust.OnPause` calls on each Activity of your app before, you should remove them.

2. Edit the `OnActivityResumed(Activity activity)` method and add a call to `Adjust.OnResume()`. Edit the `OnActivityPaused(Activity activity)` method and add a call to `Adjust.OnPause()`.

3. After the adjust SDK is configured, add a call to the `RegisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks` method with an instance of the created `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` class.

    ```cs
    using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

    // ...

    [Application(AllowBackup = true)]
    public class GlobalApplication : Application
    {
        public GlobalApplication(IntPtr javaReference, JniHandleOwnership transfer) : base(javaReference, transfer)
        {
        }

        public override void OnCreate()
        {
            base.OnCreate();

            string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
            string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;

            var config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

            Adjust.OnCreate(config);

            RegisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks(new ActivityLifecycleCallbacks());
        }

        private class ActivityLifecycleCallbacks : Java.Lang.Object, IActivityLifecycleCallbacks
        {
            public void OnActivityPaused(Activity activity)
            {
                Adjust.OnPause();
            }

            public void OnActivityResumed(Activity activity)
            {
                Adjust.OnResume()
            }

            public void OnActivityCreated(Activity activity, Bundle savedInstanceState)
            {
            }

            public void OnActivityDestroyed(Activity activity)
            {
            }

            public void OnActivitySaveInstanceState(Activity activity, Bundle outState)
            {
            }

            public void OnActivityStarted(Activity activity)
            {
            }

            public void OnActivityStopped(Activity activity)
            {
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ![][session_tracking_new]

### <a id="session-tracking-api9"></a>API level 9 until 13

If your app's minimal supported API level is between `9` and `13`, consider updating it to at least `14` to simplify the integration process in the long term. Consult the official Android [dashboard][android-dashboard] to know the latest market share of the major versions.

If you still want to target these lower API levels, in order to provide proper session tracking it is required to call certain adjust SDK methods every time any Activity resumes or pauses. Otherwise the SDK might miss a session start or session end. In order to do so you should **follow these steps for each Activity of your app**:

1. Open the source file of your Activity.
2. Add the `using` statement at the top of the file.
3. In your Activity's `OnResume` method call `Adjust.OnResume`. Create the method if needed.
4. In your Activity's `OnPause` method call `Adjust.OnPause`. Create the method if needed.

After these steps your activity should look like this:

```cs
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

[Activity(Label = "Example", MainLauncher = true)]
public class MainActivity : Activity
{
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);
    }

    protected override void OnResume()
    {
        base.OnResume();

        Adjust.OnResume();
    }

    protected override void OnPause()
    {
        base.OnPause();

        Adjust.OnPause();
    }
}
```

![][session_tracking_old]

Repeat these steps for **every** Activity of your app. Don't forget these steps when you create new Activities in the future. Depending on your coding style you might want to implement this in a common superclass of all your Activities.

### <a id="adjust-logging"></a>Adjust logging

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see in tests by calling `SetLogLevel` on your `AdjustConfig` instance with one of the following parameters:

```cs
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Verbose); 	// enable all logging
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Debug);   	// enable more logging
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Info);    	// the default
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Warn);    	// disable info logging
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Error);   	// disable warnings as well
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Assert);  	// disable errors as well
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Supress);	// disable all logging
```

If you don't want your app in production to display any logs coming from the adjust SDK, then you should select `LogLevel.Supress` and in addition to that, initialise `AdjustConfig` object with another constructor where you should enable suppress log level mode:

```cs
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;

AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment, true);
config.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Supress);

Adjust.OnCreate(config);
```

### <a id="build-your-app"></a>Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you should carefully read the SDK logs in the console. After the app is launched for the first time, you should see the info log `Install tracked`.

![][run]

## <a id="additional-features"></a>Additional features

Once you integrate the adjust SDK into your app, you can take advantage of the following features.

### <a id="event-tracking"></a>Event tracking

You can use adjust to track events. Lets say you want to track every tap on a particular button. You would create a new event token in your [dashboard], which has an associated event token - looking something like `abc123`. In your button's `Click` handler you would then add the following lines to track the tap:

```cs
AdjustEvent eventClick = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

Adjust.TrackEvent(eventClick);
```

When tapping the button you should now see `Event tracked` in the logs.

The event instance can be used to configure the event further before tracking it.

### <a id="revenue-tracking"></a>Revenue tracking

If your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making In-App Purchases, then you can track those revenues with events. Lets say a tap is worth one Euro cent. You could then track the revenue event like this:

```cs
AdjustEvent eventRevenue = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

adjustEvent.SetRevenue(0.01, "EUR");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

When you set a currency token, adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your choice. Read more about [currency conversion here][currency-conversion].

You can read more about revenue and event tracking in the [event tracking guide][event-tracking].

### <a id="revenue-deduplication"></a>Revenue deduplication

You can also add an optional order ID to avoid tracking duplicated revenues. The last ten order IDs are remembered, and revenue events with duplicated order IDs are skipped. This is especially useful for In-App Purchase tracking. You can see an example below.

If you want to track in-app purchases, please make sure to call the `TrackEvent` only if the transaction is finished and item is purchased. That way you can avoid tracking revenue that is not actually being generated.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

adjustEvent.SetRevenue(0.01, "EUR");
adjustEvent.SetOrderId("YourOrderId");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

### <a id="iap-verification"></a>In-App Purchase verification

In-App purchase verification can be done with Xamarin purchase SDK which is currently being developed and will soon be publicly available. For more information, please contact support@adjust.com.

### <a id="callback-parameters"></a>Callback parameters

You can register a callback URL for your events in your [dashboard]. We will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event is tracked. You can add callback parameters to that event by calling `AddCallbackParameter` on the event before tracking it. We will then append these parameters to your callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL `http://www.adjust.com/callback` then track an event like this:

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

adjustEvent.AddCallbackParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.AddCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

```
http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar
```

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{gps_adid}` that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback, this placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current device. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event, these parameters won't even be read.

You can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our [callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].

### <a id="partner-parameters"></a>Partner parameters

You can also add parameters to be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your adjust dashboard.

This works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the `AddPartnerParameter` method on your `AdjustEvent` instance.

```cs
AdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

adjustEvent.AddPartnerParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.AddPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust.TrackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

You can read more about special partners and these integrations in our [guide to special partners][special-partners].

### <a id="session-parameters"></a>Session parameters

Some parameters are saved to be sent in every event and session of the adjust SDK. Once you have added any of these parameters, you don't need to add them every time, since they will be saved locally. If you add the same parameter twice, there will be no effect.

These session parameters can be called before the adjust SDK is launched to make sure they are sent even on install. If you need to send them with an install, but can only obtain the needed values after launch, it's possible to [delay](#delay-start) the first launch of the adjust SDK to allow this behaviour.

### <a id="session-callback-parameters"></a>Session callback parameters

The same callback parameters that are registered for [events](#callback-parameters) can be also saved to be sent in every event or session of the adjust SDK.

The session callback parameters have a similar interface to the event callback parameters. Instead of adding the key and it's value to an event, it's added through a call to `Adjust.AddSessionCallbackParameter(String key, String value)`:

```cs
Adjust.AddSessionCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");
```

The session callback parameters will be merged with the callback parameters added to an event. The callback parameters added to an event have precedence over the session callback parameters. Meaning that, when adding a callback parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the callback parameter added to the event.

It's possible to remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `Adjust.RemoveSessionCallbackParameter(String key)`.

```cs
Adjust.RemoveSessionCallbackParameter("foo");
```

If you wish to remove all keys and their corresponding values from the session callback parameters, you can reset it with the method `Adjust.ResetSessionCallbackParameters()`.

```cs
Adjust.ResetSessionCallbackParameters();
```

### <a id="session-partner-parameters"></a>Session partner parameters

In the same way that there are [session callback parameters](#session-callback-parameters) sent in every event or session of the adjust SDK, there is also session partner parameters.

These will be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your adjust [dashboard].

The session partner parameters have a similar interface to the event partner parameters. Instead of adding the key and it's value to an event, it's added through a call to `Adjust.AddSessionPartnerParameter(String key, String value)`:

```cs
Adjust.AddSessionPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");
```

The session partner parameters will be merged with the partner parameters added to an event. The partner parameters added to an event have precedence over the session partner parameters. Meaning that, when adding a partner parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the partner parameter added to the event.

It's possible to remove a specific session partner parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `Adjust.RemoveSessionPartnerParameter(String key)`.

```cs
Adjust.RemoveSessionPartnerParameter("foo");
```

If you wish to remove all keys and their corresponding values from the session partner parameters, you can reset it with the method `Adjust.ResetSessionPartnerParameters()`.

```cs
Adjust.ResetSessionPartnerParameters();
```

### <a id="delay-start"></a>Delay start

Delaying the start of the adjust SDK allows your app some time to obtain session parameters, such as unique identifiers, to be sent on install.

Set the initial delay time in seconds with the method `SetDelayStart` in the `AdjustConfig` instance:

```cs
config.SetDelayStart(5.5);
```

In this case, this will make the adjust SDK not send the initial install session and any event created for 5.5 seconds. After this time is expired or if you call `Adjust.SendFirstPackages()` in the meanwhile, every session parameter will be added to the delayed install session and events and the adjust SDK will resume as usual.

**The maximum delay start time of the adjust SDK is 10 seconds**.

### <a id="attribution-callback"></a>Attribution callback

You can register a callback to be notified of tracker attribution changes. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this information can not by provided synchronously. Follow these steps to implement the optional callback in your app:

Please make sure to consider our [applicable attribution data policies][attribution-data].

1. Implement the `IOnAttributionChangedListener` interface in your Application class.

	```cs
	[Application (AllowBackup = true)]
	public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnAttributionChangedListener
	{
	    ...
	}
	```
2. Override the `OnAttributionChanged` callback which will be triggered when the attribution has been changed.

	```cs
	public void OnAttributionChanged(AdjustAttribution attribution)
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("Attribution changed!");
	    Console.WriteLine("New attribution: {0}", attribution.ToString ());
	}
	```

3. Set your Application class instance as the listener in the `AdjustConfig` object.

	```cs
	AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, yourAppToken, environment);

	config.SetOnAttributionChangedListener(this);

	Adjust.OnCreate (config);
	```

The callback function will be called when the SDK receives final attribution data. Within the callback function you have access to the `attribution` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its properties:

- `string TrackerToken` the tracker token of the current attribution.
- `string TrackerName` the tracker name of the current attribution.
- `string Network` the network grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string Campaign` the campaign grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string Adgroup` the ad group grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string Creative` the creative grouping level of the current attribution.
- `string ClickLabel` the click label of the current attribution.
- `string Adid` the adjust device identifier.

### <a id="session-event-callbacks"></a>Session and event callbacks

You can register a callback to be notified of successful and failed events and/or sessions. Like with attribution callback, this should be done in your custom class which implements corresponding interface for each callback method.

Follow the same steps to implement the following callback function for successful tracked events. You need to set the listener object on `AdjustConfig` instance which implements `IOnEventTrackingSucceededListener` interface:

```cs
[Application(AllowBackup = true)]
public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnEventTrackingSucceededListener
{
    public override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();

        string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
        string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
        AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

        // Set event tracking success callback.
        config.SetOnEventTrackingSucceededListener(this);

        Adjust.OnCreate(config);
    }

    public void OnFinishedEventTrackingSucceeded(AdjustEventSuccess eventSuccess)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event tracking succeeded! " + eventSuccess.ToString());
    }
}
```

For failed tracked events, you need to set the listener object on `AdjustConfig` instance which implements `IOnEventTrackingFailedListener` interface:

```cs
[Application(AllowBackup = true)]
public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnEventTrackingFailedListener
{
    public override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();

        string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
        string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
        AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

        // Set event tracking failure callback.
        config.SetOnEventTrackingFailedListener(this);

        Adjust.OnCreate(config);
    }

    public void OnFinishedEventTrackingFailed(AdjustEventFailure eventFailure)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event tracking failed! " + eventFailure.ToString());
    }
}
```

For successful tracked sessions, you need to set the listener object on `AdjustConfig` instance which implements `IOnSessionTrackingSucceededListener` interface:

```cs
[Application(AllowBackup = true)]
public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnSessionTrackingSucceededListener
{
    public override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();

        string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
        string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
        AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

        // Set session tracking success callback.
        config.SetOnSessionTrackingSucceededListener(this);

        Adjust.OnCreate(config);
    }

    public void OnFinishedSessionTrackingSucceeded(AdjustSessionSuccess sessionSuccess)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Session tracking succeeded! " + sessionSuccess.ToString());
    }
}
```

For failed tracked sessions, you need to set the listener object on `AdjustConfig` instance which implements `IOnSessionTrackingFailedListener` interface:

```cs
[Application(AllowBackup = true)]
public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnSessionTrackingFailedListener
{
    public override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();

        string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
        string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
        AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

        // Set session tracking failure callback.
        config.SetOnSessionTrackingFailedListener(this);

        Adjust.OnCreate(config);
    }

    public void OnFinishedSessionTrackingFailed(AdjustSessionFailure sessionFailure)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Session tracking failed! " + sessionFailure.ToString());
    }
}
```

The callback functions will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the callback you have access to a response data object specifically for the callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:

- `string Message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.
- `string Timestamp` timestamp from the server.
- `string Adid` a unique device identifier provided by adjust.
- `JSONObject JsonResponse` the JSON object with the response from the server.

Both event response data objects contain:

- `string EventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event.

And both event and session failed objects also contain:

- `bool WillRetry` indicates there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.

### <a id="disable-tracking"></a>Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking any activities of the current device by assigning parameter `false` to `Enabled` property. **This setting is remembered between sessions**, but it can only be activated after the first session.

```cs
Adjust.Enabled = false;
```

You can check if the adjust SDK is currently enabled by checking the `Enabled` property. It is always possible to activate the adjust SDK by invoking `Enabled` with the enabled parameter as `true`.

### <a id="offline-mode"></a>Offline mode

You can put the adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers, while still retaining tracked data to be sent later. While in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful to avoid triggering too many events while in offline mode.

You can activate offline mode by calling method `SetOfflineMode` with parameter `true`:

```cs
Adjust.SetOfflineMode (true);
```

Conversely, you can deactivate offline mode calling `SetOfflineMode` method with parameter `false`. When the adjust SDK is put back in online mode, all saved information is send to our servers with the correct time information.

Unlike disabling tracking, **this setting is not remembered** between sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.

### <a id="event-buffering"></a>Event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, then you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in a single batch per minute.

You can enable event buffering with your `AdjustConfig` instance:

```cs
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, yourAppToken, environment);

config.SetEventBufferingEnabled((Java.Lang.Boolean)true);

Adjust.OnCreate(config);
```

If nothing is set, event buffering is **disabled by default**.

### <a id="sdk-signature"></a>SDK signature

An account manager must activate the Adjust SDK signature. Contact Adjust support (support@adjust.com) if you are interested in using this feature.

If the SDK signature has already been enabled on your account and you have access to App Secrets in your Adjust Dashboard, please use the method below to integrate the SDK signature into your app.

An App Secret is set by passing all secret parameters (`secretId`, `info1`, `info2`, `info3`, `info4`) to `setAppSecret` method of `AdjustConfig` instance:

```csharp
AdjustConfig adjustConfig = AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

adjustConfig.SetAppSecret(secretId, info1, info2, info3, info4);

Adjust.OnCreate(adjustConfig);
```

### <a id="background-tracking"></a>Background tracking

The default behaviour of the adjust SDK is to **pause sending HTTP requests while the app is in the background**. You can change this in your `AdjustConfig` instance:

```cs
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, yourAppToken, environment);

config.SetSendInBackground(true);

Adjust.OnCreate(config);
```

If nothing set, sending in background is **disabled by default**.

### <a id="device-ids"></a>Device IDs

The adjust SDK offers you possibility to obtain some of the device identifiers.

### <a id="di-gps-adid"></a>Google Play Services advertising identifier

Certain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate Device and Client IDs in order to prevent duplicated reporting.

If you need to obtain the Google Advertising ID, there is a restriction that only allows it to be read in a background thread. If you call the function `getGoogleAdId` with the context and a `OnDeviceIdsRead` instance, it will work in any situation:

```cs
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

[Application(AllowBackup = true)]
public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnDeviceIdsRead
{
    public override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();

        string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
        string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;

        var config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

        Adjust.OnCreate(config);

        Adjust.GetGoogleAdId(this, this);
    }

    public void OnGoogleAdIdRead(string googleAdId)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Google Ad Id read: " + googleAdId);
    }
}
```

Inside the method `onGoogleAdIdRead` of the `OnDeviceIdsRead` instance, you will have access to the Google Advertising ID through the variable `googleAdId`.

### <a id="di-fire-adid"></a>Amazon advertising identifier

If you need to obtain the Amazon advertising ID, you can call the `getAmazonAdId` method of the `Adjust` instance and pass your callback as a parameter to which the Amazon advertising ID value will be sent once obtained:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Amazon Ad Id: " + Adjust.GetAmazonAdId(this));
```

### <a id="di-adid"></a>Adjust device identifier

For each device with your app installed on it, the adjust backend generates a unique **adjust device identifier** (**adid**). In order to obtain this identifier, you can access the following property of the `Adjust` instance:

```cs
String adid = Adjust.Adid;
```

**Note**: Information about **adid** is available after app installation has been tracked by the adjust backend. From that moment on, the adjust SDK has information about the device **adid** and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access the **adid** value before the SDK has been initialised and installation of your app has been successfully tracked.

### <a id="user-attribution"></a>User attribution

As described in the [attribution callback section](#attribution-callback), this callback is triggered and provides you information about new attributions whenever there is a change. If you want to access information about your user's current attribution at any other time, you can access the following property of the `Adjust` instance:

```cs
AdjustAttribution attribution = Adjust.Attribution;
```

**Note**: Information about current attribution is available after app installation has been tracked by the adjust backend and attribution callback has been triggered. From that moment on, the adjust SDK has information about a user's attribution and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access a user's attribution value before the SDK has been initialised and attribution callback has been triggered.

### <a id="push-token"></a>Push token

To send us the push notification token, add the following call to Adjust **once you have obtained your token or when ever it's value is changed**:

```cs
Adjust.SetPushToken(pushNotificationsToken, this);
```

Push tokens are used for Audience Builder and client callbacks, and they are required for the upcoming uninstall tracking feature.

### <a id="track-additional-ids"></a>Track additional device identifiers

If you are distributing your Android app **outside of the Google Play Store** and would like to track additional device identifiers (IMEI and MEID), you need to explicitly instruct the Adjust SDK to do so. You can do that by calling the `setReadMobileEquipmentIdentity` method of the `AdjustConfig` instance. **The Adjust SDK does not collect these identifiers by default**.

```csharp
AdjustConfig adjustConfig = AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

adjustConfig.setReadMobileEquipmentIdentity(true);

Adjust.OnCreate(adjustConfig);
```
You will also need to add the `ReadPhoneState` permission to your project. See the [permissions](#sdk-permissions) section for more info on permissions.

In order to use this feature, additional steps are required within your Adjust Dashboard. For more information, please contact your dedicated account manager or write an email to support@adjust.com.

### <a id="pre-installed-trackers"></a>Pre-installed trackers

If you want to use the adjust SDK to recognize users that found your app pre-installed on their device, follow these steps.

1. Create a new tracker in your [dashboard].
2. Open your Application class and add set the default tracker of your `AdjustConfig`:

    ```cs
    AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, yourAppToken, environment);

    config.SetDefaultTracker("{TrackerToken}");

    Adjust.OnCreate(config);
    ```

  Replace `{TrackerToken}` with the tracker token you created in step 2. Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker URL (including `http://app.adjust.com/`). In your source code, you should specify only the six-character token and not the entire URL.

3. Build and run your app. You should see a line like the following in app's log output:

    ```
    Default tracker: 'abc123'
    ```

### <a id="deeplinking"></a>Deep linking

If you are using the adjust tracker URL with an option to deep link into your app from the URL, there is the possibility to get information about the deep link URL and its content. Hitting the URL can happen when the user already has your app installed (standard deep linking scenario) or if they do not have the app on their device (deferred deep linking scenario). In the standard deep linking scenario, the Android platform offers native support for you to get the info about the deep link content. The deferred deep linking scenario is something that the Android platform does not support out of the box. In this scenario, the adjust SDK will offer you the tools you need to get the information about the deep link content.

### <a id="deeplinking-standard"></a>Standard deep linking scenario

If a user has your app installed and you want it to launch after hitting an adjust tracker URL with the `deep_link` parameter in it, you need enable deep linking in your app. This is done by choosing a desired **unique scheme name** and assigning it to the Activity which you want to launch once the app opens after the user has clicked on the link. This can be done by setting certain properties on the Activity class which you would like to see launched once the deep link has been clicked and your app has opened. You need to set up a proper intent filter and name the scheme:

```cs
[Activity(Label = "Example", MainLauncher = true)]
	[IntentFilter
	 (new[] { Intent.ActionView },
		Categories = new[] { Intent.CategoryDefault, Intent.CategoryBrowsable },
		DataScheme = "adjustExample")]
	public class MainActivity : Activity
	{
	    // ...
	}
```

With this now set, you need to use the assigned scheme name in the adjust tracker URL's `deep_link` parameter. A tracker URL without any information added to the deep link can be built to look something like this:

```
https://app.adjust.com/abc123?deep_link=adjustExample%3A%2F%2F
```

Please, have in mind that the `deep_link` parameter value in the URL **must be URL encoded**.

After clicking this tracker URL, and with the app set as described above, your app will launch along with the `MainActivity` intent. Inside the `MainActivity` class, you will automatically be provided with the information about the `deep_link` parameter content. Once this content is delivered to you, it **will not be encoded**, although it was encoded in the URL.

Depending on the `launchMode` setting of your Activity, information about the `deep_link` parameter content will be delivered to the appropriate place in the Activity file. For more information about the possible values of the `launchMode` property, check [the official Android documentation][android-launch-modes].

There are two possible places in which information about the deep link content will be delivered to your desired Activity via `Intent` object - either in the Activity's `OnCreate` or `OnNewIntent` method. After the app has launched and one of these methods is triggered, you will be able to get the actual deeplink passed in the `deep_link` parameter in the click URL. You can then use this information to do some additional logic in your app.

You can extract the deep link content from these two methods like this:

```cs
using Android.Content;
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);

    Intent intent = this.Intent;
    var data = intent.Data;

    // data.ToString() -> This is your deep_link parameter value.
}
```

```cs
using Android.Content;
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

protected override void OnNewIntent(Android.Content.Intent intent)
{
    base.OnNewIntent(intent);

    var data = intent.Data;

    // data.ToString() -> This is your deep_link parameter value.
}
```

### <a id="deeplinking-deferred"></a>Deferred deep linking scenario

Deferred deep linking scenario happens when a user clicks on the adjust tracker URL with the `deep_link` parameter in it, but does not have the app installed on the device at the moment of click. After that, the user will get redirected to the Play Store to download and install your app. After opening it for the first time, the content of the `deep_link` parameter will be delivered to the app.

In order to get info about the `deep_link` parameter content in a deferred deep linking scenario, you should set a listener method on the `AdjustConfig` object. Listener object needs to implement `IOnDeeplinkResponseListener` interface and override it's `LaunchReceivedDeeplink` method. This will get triggered once the adjust SDK gets the info about the deep link content from the backend.

```cs
[Application(AllowBackup = true)]
public class GlobalApplication : Application, IOnDeeplinkResponseListener
{
    public override void OnCreate()
    {
        base.OnCreate();

        string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
        string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
        AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

        // Set deferred deeplink callback.
        config.SetOnDeeplinkResponseListener(this);

        Adjust.OnCreate(config);
    }

    public bool LaunchReceivedDeeplink(Android.Net.Uri deeplink)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Deferred deeplink arrived! URL = " + deeplink.ToString());

        return true;
        // return false;
    }
}
```

Once the adjust SDK receives the info about the deep link content from the backend, it will deliver you the info about its content in this listener and expect the `bool` return value from you. This return value represents your decision on whether the adjust SDK should launch the Activity to which you have assigned the scheme name from the deep link (like in the standard deep linking scenario) or not.

If you return `true`, we will launch it and the exact same scenario which is described in the [Standard deep linking scenario chapter](#deeplinking-standard) will happen. If you do not want the SDK to launch the Activity, you can return `false` from this listener and based on the deep link content decide on your own what to do next in your app.

### <a id="deeplinking-reattribution"></a>Reattribution via deep links

Adjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns with usage of deep links. For more information on how to do that, please check our [official docs][reattribution-with-deeplinks].

If you are using this feature, in order for your user to be properly reattributed, you need to make one additional call to the adjust SDK in your app.

Once you have received deep link content information in your app, add a call to `Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl` method. By making this call, the adjust SDK will try to find if there is any new attribution info inside of the deep link and if any, it will be sent to the adjust backend. If your user should be reattributed due to a click on the adjust tracker URL with deep link content in it, you will see the [attribution callback](#attribution-callback) in your app being triggered with new attribution info for this user.

The call to `Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl` should be done like this:

```cs
using Android.Content;
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);

    Intent intent = this.Intent;
    var data = intent.Data;

    // data.ToString() -> This is your deep_link parameter value.

    Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl(data);
}
```

```cs
using Android.Content;
using Com.Adjust.Sdk;

// ...

protected override void OnNewIntent(Android.Content.Intent intent)
{
    base.OnNewIntent(intent);

    var data = intent.Data;

    // data.ToString() -> This is your deep_link parameter value.

    Adjust.AppWillOpenUrl(data);
}
```
